        <h1>CSS Based Maze Game</h1>
        <img src="#">
        <p>
            Unlike other online games which rely on a scripting language to accept user input, update the game display,
            and alert the user when they win (or lose) <em>THE GAME</em> exclusively employs HTML and CSS to impliment
            it's functionality.
        </p>
        <h2>Game Play</h2>
        <p>
            The user is initially presented with a square gameboard with the top-left corner colored blue with text
            inviting the user to hover over it; no other instructions are provided however. After trial and error, the
            user discovers that if they move their mouse to the right another, different-colored square appears, but if
            they leave either of the squares they have already visited, all but the initial starting tile disappear.
        </p>
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
            The core functionality of the game is based on CSS <span class='code-css'>:hover</span> pseudoselectors, used in a manner
            similar to website drop-down menus. Just like on a drop down menu, the menu appears after the user hovers
            the mouse over a visible section of the menu, but only disappears after the user removes the cursor from
            either the newly appeared menu or the initial area which caused the menu to appear. Taking advantage of that
            functionality <em>The Game</em> allows users to hover through the path in the maze, remaining visible if
            they don't leave the already discovered path, but disappears as soon as they stray, even onto an area which
            will eventually be part of the path!
