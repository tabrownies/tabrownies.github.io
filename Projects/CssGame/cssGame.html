                Unlike other online games which rely on a scripting language to accept user input, update the game
                display,
                and alert the user when they win (or lose) <em>THE GAME</em> exclusively employs HTML and CSS to
                impliment
                it's functionality. Play it <a href="THE_GAME/index.html">here!</a>
            </p>
            <h3>Game Play</h3>
            <p>
                The user is initially presented with a square gameboard with the top-left corner colored blue with text
                inviting the user to hover over it; no other instructions are provided however. After trial and error,
                the
                user discovers that if they move their mouse to the right another, different-colored square appears, but
                if
                they leave either of the squares they have already visited, all but the initial starting tile disappear.
                Guessing as they go, they move through the board until they finally reach the <em>Finish!</em> tile,
                which
                they click on and reach the success screen.
            </p>
            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>
                The core functionality of the game is based on CSS <span class='code-css'>:hover</span> pseudoselectors,
                used in a manner
                similar to website drop-down menus. Just like on a drop down menu, the menu appears after the user
                hovers
                the mouse over a visible section of the menu, but only disappears after the user removes the cursor from
                either the newly appeared menu or the initial area which caused the menu to appear. Taking advantage of
                that
                functionality <em>The Game</em> allows users to hover through the path in the maze, remaining visible if
                they don't leave the already discovered path, but disappears as soon as they stray, even onto an area
                which
                will eventually be part of the path! The final interaction of clicking the game screen is simply
                implemented
                using a link. View the code <a href="#">here</a>.
