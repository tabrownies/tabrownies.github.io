            <h2>Junkyard Joystick</h2>

            <!--This should be replaced with a video-->
            <p>
                Built primarily out of boxes, bottle caps, and other materials I scavenged from my family's recycling
                bin over winter break, this joystick is build completely from used materials and basic electronic
                components.
            </p>
            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>
                Like most digital joysticks, the Junkyard Joystick utilizes four buttons hidden underneath the casing to
                determine its position. As the stick is pivoted, the bottom pushes buttons positioned in a cross pattern
                around it. If the left button is pushed, the joystick has been pushed to the right. Similarly the right
                button's activation signifies movement to the left, up signifies down, and down, up. These push buttons
                are monitored by an Arduino microcontroller which translates them into mouse movements and delivers
                commands to a connected computer over a usb connection.
            </p>
            <h3>Material Choice and Usage</h3>
            <p>
                The materials used to create this joystick were fittingly, from the junkyard. This lead to some
                interesting innovation, my favorite of which was the use of the milk jug cap. Punching the dowel though
                the bottom of the cap and securing it with hot glue provided the two necessary degrees of rotational
                freedom, while restricting translation and axial rotation. I also enjoyed using the soda bottle lid to
                provide extra width to the bottom of the dowel and vertically fastened perfboard to position the buttons
                where they would be tapped by that soda lid.
            </p>
