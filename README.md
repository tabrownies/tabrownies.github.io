# Portfolio Website
This website is my portfolio and resume. It is where I will display my projects and give easy access to my resume. It is built in pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript with no backend. This allows it to maintain a simple design with little upkeep.
The goals of this site are the following
1. Display to potential employers my skillset
1. Display to peers my projects
1. Practice vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript
1. Practice a mature development pipeline using git and GitHub
