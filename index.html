            <h2>Hi, my name is Timothy Brown</h2>
            <div class="picture-frame">

            <p>
                I am a problem solver and inventor.
                My goal is to develop technology products that simplify people's lives and save them time, thus saving them money.
                
            </p>
            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            <h3>KMeans Image Filter</h3>
            <div class="picture-frame"><img class="project-picture" src="Projects/KMeansImageFilter/kmeans_star_wars.png"></div>
            <p>
                I developed a <a href="Projects/KMeansImageFilter/kmeanImageFilter/index.html">simple web application</a> which uses KMeans clustering to apply an interesting filter to images. The filter groups similar colors and reduces the number of different color values in the image from hundreds or thousands to 5-10 while maintaining the overall detail in the image.
                This is the filter I used to create the Star Wars image above. (This project is still in development.)
            </p>
            <h3>Reverse Indexing</h3>
            <div class="picture-frame"><img class="project-picture" src="Projects/ReverseIndexing/reverse_indexing.png"></div>
            <p>
                As a research lead in the <a href="https://familytech.byu.edu/">Family History Technology Lab</a>, I made the <a href="https://indexing.familytech.byu.edu/home">Reverse Indexing</a> application
                12 times more efficient in both storage usage and speed. Then realizing the output from Reverse Indexing was often erroneous, I
                built a pipeline from the existing application to a <a href="https://indexing-go.familytech.byu.edu">new iOS and Android mobile app</a> used to clean up the annotation
                errors. These features support over ten thousand users as they electronically archive millions of
                records every year.
            </p>
            <h3>Ragnar Rankings</h3>
            <div class="picture-frame"><img class="project-picture" src="Projects/RagnarScraper/ragnar.png"> </div>
            <p>
                I competed in a relay race called <a href="https://www.runragnar.com/?section=31%20Days%20Challange">the Ragnar</a>. Although the team rankings were released and included individual
                times, I couldn't easily compare my personal times against other individual racers'. I developed
                a Python program which reads the contents of Ragnar's results website and sorts the racers individually, revealing
                my actual placement in the race.

                PS2X GitHub Contribution
            </h3>
            <div class="picture-frame"><img class="project-picture" src="Projects/PS2XContribution/PS2_Dualshock2_Controller.jpeg"></div>
            <p>
                After using an open source <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> library in a number of personal projects, I contributed to it's development on GitHub.
                The library translates the input from a Playstation 2 controller so an Arduino microcontroller can understand it. The pull request (still unmerged) is found <a href="https://github.com/madsci1016/Arduino-PS2X/pull/32">here.</a>
            </p>
            <h3>Mario Kart Data Science</h3>
            <div class="picture-frame"><img class="project-picture" src="Projects/MarioKartDatascience/mariokart_datascience/analysis_pages/mk8d_wr_comp/mario_regression_separated.png"></div>
            <p>
                I love to play <a href="#">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> and have performed data science on courses and kart/character choices using world record times as a metric. This was accomplished using web-scrapping, KMeans Clustering, and linear regression.
            </p>
            <h3>Website Orrery</h3>
            <div class="picture-frame"><img class="project-picture" src="Projects/WebsiteOrrery/website_orrery_screenshot2.jpg"></div>
            <p>
                A <a href="Projects/WebsiteOrrery/planetaryOrbit/index.html">simple website</a> mimicking the rotation of the planets around the sun. It was programmed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
            </p>
            <h3>Junkyard Joystick</h3>
            <div class="picture-frame"><img class="project-picture" src="Projects/Joystick/joystick.jpeg"></div>
            <p>
                Built primarily out of old cardboard boxes, bottle caps, and other materials I scavenged from my family's recycling
                bin over a winter break, this joystick is build completely from used materials and basic electronic
                components. It is powered by an <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino microcontroller</a> and can act as a mouse on Windows and MacOS computers.
            </p>
            <h3>Roman Numeral Converter</h3>
            <div class="picture-frame"><img class="project-picture" src="Projects/RomanNumeralConverter/RomanNumeralConverterScreenshot.jpg"></div>
            <p>
                A simple web application which converts numbers between Roman Numerals and Arabic Numerals. It can be accessed <a href="projects/RomanNumeralConverter/RomanNumeralConverter/index.html">here.</a>
            </p>
            <h3>Brick Breaker</h3>
            <div class="picture-frame"><img class="project-picture" src="Projects/BrickBreaker/brickBreakerScreenshot.jpg"></div>
            <p>
                A simple brick-breaker game I built in eighth grade using basic Javascript and an HTML canvas. While inspired by a similar game on my dad's Blackberry, the design, implementation, and code were all original to me. Play it <a href="Projects/BrickBreaker/Brick-Breaker/index.html">here.</a>
            </p>
            <h3>Pure CSS Maze Game</h3>
            <div class="picture-frame"><img class="project-picture" src="Projects/CssGame/theGame.png"></div>
            <p>
                Unlike other online games which rely on a scripting language to accept user input, update the game
                display,
                and alert the user when they win (or lose), <a href="Projects/CssGame/THE_GAME/index.html"><em>THE GAME</em></a> exclusively employs HTML and CSS to
                implement
                its functionality.
            </p>
            <h3>Brown Robotics</h3>
            <div class="picture-frame"><img class="project-picture" src="/assets/images/home/brown_robotics.jpeg"> </div>
            <p>
                After placing fourth in a <a href="https://tsaweb.org/events-conferences/recent-national-tsa-conferences">national robotics competition,</a> I marketed a week long summer
                robotics class for youth. I developed a curriculum and taught 10 teenagers the basics of programming,
                engineering, and robotics. After the first week of classes, both the youth and their parents requested a
                second session, which I then provided.
