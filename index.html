            <h2>Hi, My name is Timothy Brown</h2>
            <p>
                I am a problem solver and inventor.
                My goal is to create technology products that save people money by simplifying their life.
            </p>
            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            <h3>Reverse Indexing</h3>
            <p>
                <!-- try 1 -->
                As an research assistant for the <a href="https://familytech.byu.edu/">Family History Technology Lab</a>, I made the <a href="https://indexing.familytech.byu.edu/home">Reverse Indexing</a> application
                12 times more efficient. Then realizing the output from Reverse Indexing was often erroneous, I
                built a pipeline from the existing application to a <a href="https://indexing-go.familytech.byu.edu">new iOS and Android mobile app</a> used to clean up the
                errors. These features support over ten thousand users as they electronically archive millions of
                records every year.

                <!-- Family history is one of the fastest growing hobbies in the United States, and with the wealth of
                census, birth, and marriage records now freely available online, searching for your ancestors should now
                be easier than ever, but it's not. Each of these records needs to be electronically <em>indexed</em> to
                enable people to easily find the connections between their ancestors. Classically this has been done
                manually by human volunteers. I helped develop reverse indexing, an application which uses machine
                learning to assist human volunteers across the world to quickly index millions of records a year.
                Reverse Indexing first segments the images to reduce unnecessary time spent finding the text on the
                page, and gives the user suggestions as to what the text says. After indexed by multiple users, the
                document is pieced back together and submitted to the public archive. -->

            <h3>Brown Robotics</h3>
            <p>
                After placing fourth in an <a href="https://tsaweb.org/events-conferences/recent-national-tsa-conferences">national team robotics competition,</a> I marketed a week long summer
                robotics class for youth. I developed a curriculum and taught 10 teenagers the basics of programming,
                engineering, and robotics. After the first week of classes, both the youth and their parents requested a
                second session, which I then provided.
            </p>
            <h3>Ragnar Rankings</h3>
            <p>
                I competed in a relay race called <a href="https://www.runragnar.com/?section=31%20Days%20Challange">the Ragnar</a>. Although the team rankings released included individual
                times, an easy way to learn how well you compared individually against other racers was not provided. I developed
                a Python program which read the contents of Ragnar's website and sorted the racers individually, revealing
                my actual placement in the race.

            <!-- <h2>More about me</h2>
            <p>
                As an Applied Math major at BYU, my peers and I learn deep mathematical theory Monday, Wednesday, and
                Friday then immediately apply those concepts in Python based labs Tuesday and Thursday. Subjects studied
                include calculus on arbitrary Banach spaces, Fourier analysis, and Bayesian statistics. -->

                Besides my courses in math, I have enrolled and succeeded in classes covering subjects in computer
                science and product management. Outside of my course work, I am an electronics hobbyist comfortable with
                microcontrolers, breadboard circuitry, and soldering. I also enjoy working software only projects (such
                as this website) or simply building with Legos.
