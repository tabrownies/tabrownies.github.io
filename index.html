            <h2>Hi, my name is Timothy Brown</h2>
            <p>
                I am a problem solver and inventor.
                My goal is to create technology products that save people money by simplifying their life and saving them time.
            </p>
            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            <h3>Reverse Indexing</h3>
            <p>
                <!-- try 1 -->
                As an research assistant for the <a href="https://familytech.byu.edu/">Family History Technology Lab</a>, I made the <a href="https://indexing.familytech.byu.edu/home">Reverse Indexing</a> application
                12 times more efficient. Then realizing the output from Reverse Indexing was often erroneous, I
                built a pipeline from the existing application to a <a href="https://indexing-go.familytech.byu.edu">new iOS and Android mobile app</a> used to clean up the
                errors. These features support over ten thousand users as they electronically archive millions of
                records every year.

                
            </p>
            <h3>Brown Robotics</h3>
            <p>
                After placing fourth in an <a href="https://tsaweb.org/events-conferences/recent-national-tsa-conferences">national robotics competition,</a> I marketed a week long summer
                robotics class for youth. I developed a curriculum and taught 10 teenagers the basics of programming,
                engineering, and robotics. After the first week of classes, both the youth and their parents requested a
                second session, which I then provided.
            </p>
            <h3>Ragnar Rankings</h3>
            <p>
                I competed in a relay race called <a href="https://www.runragnar.com/?section=31%20Days%20Challange">the Ragnar</a>. Although the team rankings released included individual
                times, an easy way to learn how well you compared individually against other racers was not provided. I developed
                a Python program which read the contents of Ragnar's website and sorted the racers individually, revealing
                my actual placement in the race.
