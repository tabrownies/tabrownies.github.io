<!-- Family history is one of the fastest growing hobbies in the United States, and with the wealth of
                census, birth, and marriage records now freely available online, searching for your ancestors should now
                be easier than ever, but it's not. Each of these records needs to be electronically <em>indexed</em> to
                enable people to easily find the connections between their ancestors. Classically this has been done
                manually by human volunteers. I helped develop reverse indexing, an application which uses machine
                learning to assist human volunteers across the world to quickly index millions of records a year.
                Reverse Indexing first segments the images to reduce unnecessary time spent finding the text on the
                page, and gives the user suggestions as to what the text says. After indexed by multiple users, the
                document is pieced back together and submitted to the public archive. -->

            <p>
                As an Applied Math major at BYU, my peers and I learn deep mathematical theory Monday, Wednesday, and
                Friday then immediately apply those concepts in Python based labs Tuesday and Thursday. Subjects studied
                include calculus on arbitrary Banach spaces, Fourier analysis, and Bayesian statistics. -->

                Besides my courses in math, I have enrolled and succeeded in classes covering subjects in computer
                science and product management. Outside of my course work, I am an electronics hobbyist comfortable with
                microcontrolers, breadboard circuitry, and soldering. I also enjoy working software only projects (such
                as this website) or simply building with Legos.
